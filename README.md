# Little Shop: Myxology
A Turing School group project created with Rails.

## Deployment

Our app is deployed on heroku at: [Myxology](https://limitless-everglades-19318.herokuapp.com)

`https://limitless-everglades-19318.herokuapp.com`

We created an online application where visitors, registered users, merchants, and admins have a variety of interactions with our fictitious shop. Each user type has some degree of authentication and authorization on our site. A user must be registered before checking out, but a visitor can shop up to checkout without being registered. Merchants can fulfill orders according to their inventory. Admins have authorization to enable and disable a user, as well as upgrading or downgrading a user or merchant, along with other functionality.

## Learning Goals

* Advanced Rails routing (nested resources and namespacing)
* Advanced ActiveRecord for calculating statistics
* Average HTML/CSS layout and design for UX/UI
* Session management and use of POROs for shopping cart
* Authentication, Authorization, separation of user roles and permissions

Welcome to our dev environment!


## Running the tests

Your location should be the root directory of the project (`little_shop`).

From the command line run `rspec`
(This can take a moment)

`Green` is passing.
`Red` is failing.

We used `rspec`, `capybara`, and `shoulda-matchers` for testing.
We also used `FactoryBot` and `Faker` gems.

#### MVC
This project was a huge exploration into the M(odel) V(iew) C(ontroller) software architecture pattern.
We also worked with namespacing routes and authorization and authentication.

##### Example of a namespaced Controller:
